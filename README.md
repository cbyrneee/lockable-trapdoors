**Lockable Trapdoors** is a mod for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) which allows you to lock your trapdoors by crouching 
and right-clicking on them!

> **Note**
> If you're playing on a server with friends, the mod must be installed on the server and everyone playing must have it
> too. Otherwise, trapdoors may not behave correctly.
